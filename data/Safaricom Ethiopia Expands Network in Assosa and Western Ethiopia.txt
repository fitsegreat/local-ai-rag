Safaricom Ethiopia proudly announces the launch of its network in Assosa, marking another milestone in its journey to bring reliable, high-quality connectivity to all corners of the country.
Over the past two weeks, Safaricom Ethiopia has introduced its services in several major cities in Western Ethiopia, including Nekemte, Gambella, Metu, and Bedele. Today’s launch in Assosa further solidifies our presence in the region. Since officially commencing operations in Ethiopia just over two years ago, we have achieved extensive network coverage, now reaching half of the Ethiopian population across Central, Northern, Southern, Eastern, and Western areas.
Our fast 4G network in these cities in Western Ethiopia delivers seamless connectivity in the cities and their surrounding areas, including the airports. We have also opened distributor shops in these cities to offer Safaricom’s products and services, on top of providing operational support for customers. The expansion has created a total of over 600 jobs in these cities, further contributing to local economic development.
Safaricom’s introduction of M-PESA digital financial solutions in these will empower residents by enabling secure, convenient, and affordable financial transactions. This aligns with our broader mission of supporting social and economic growth through technology.
As part of our commitment to community care, we have donated 80 laptops, 16 routers, and 6 months of free unlimited internet to schools in Assosa, Nekemte, Gambella, Metu and Bedele. This initiative underscores our dedication to integrating network expansion with meaningful community contributions.
We extend our deepest gratitude to local leaders and government officials, whose support has been instrumental in making these launches possible. Safaricom Ethiopia remains committed to connecting people and fostering development across Ethiopia.
