Safaricom Ethiopia switched on its network and services in Hawassa city yesterday; the company also expanded its services to Assela, Jigjiga, Sodo and Dilla cities over the past few weeks.
New customers in these cities will be able to purchase SIM cards for 30 birr, choose their preferred numbers, buy airtime and access dedicated customer support at the Safaricom Ethiopia branded shops in their respective cities.
“We are excited to expand our coverage into Hawassa, Assela, Jigjiga, Sodo and Dilla with more cities set to join the growing Safaricom Ethiopia family. We are also delighted to have expanded our services into more regional states,” said Anwar Soussa, CEO, Safaricom Ethiopia.

In addition to the welcoming package, customers get Gursha bonus when they buy airtime and voice package.
The “07” network switch on in the five additional cities brings Safaricom Ethiopia’s current network footprint across the country to 21 cities – Dire Dawa, Harar, Haramaya, Adama, Bahir Dar, Bishoftu, Mojo, Debre Birhan, Awoday, Gondar, Addis Ababa, Sebeta, Dessie, ​Kombolcha, Jimma, Shashemene, Dilla, Sodo, Jigjiga, Assela and Hawassa.
