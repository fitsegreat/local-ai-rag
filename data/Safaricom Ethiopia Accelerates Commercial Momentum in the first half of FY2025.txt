Safaricom Ethiopia’s half year performance results of FY2025 (April 2024 – September 2024) registered accelerated commercial momentum with significant leap in both mobile (GSM) and M-PESA services.
During the FY2025 Half Year results announcement in Nairobi, Kenya, our CEO Wim Vanhelleputte said: “Having marked our 2-yr milestone in October 2024 in Ethiopia, we are proud of our performance and achievements in the period under review. We will further strengthen our efforts to sustain this commercial momentum in the second half of FY2025 to become an even more trusted partner for Ethiopia’s Digital Transformation Agenda”
In the first half of FY2025, our 07 network and services reached a population coverage of 46%, up from 30% 12 months ago. Our focus on infrastructure roll-out has now reached more than 3,000 network sites across the country, a nearly 50% increase from the 2,000 network sites of last year at the same time.
Currently, we have over 6.1 million 90-day active customers that subscribed to our GSM services (indicating a 47.3% increase compared to September 2023); and our Fast 4G Data usage has grown significantly to 6.6GB per month per mobile data user.
The total number of our registered M-PESA customers has reached 8.3 million, marking a 6-fold increase from the 1.2 million customers we had in September 2023: resulting to a total transaction of 6.4 billion birr through the M-PESA platform.
Alongside our accelerated commercial momentum and expansion of infrastructure we have shown a strong commitment to digitizing education through solidarity and emergency support. To date, we have donated about 30-million-birr worth of 400 laptops, 100 routers and over 41,000 exercise books in 20 cities across 11 regional states.
We welcome the recent foreign exchange regime reforms. These reforms will have a positive impact in the long term on our business. In the short term we are mitigating the immediate impact of the restatement of our forex denominated long-term financial leases and loans, by accelerating our efforts to localize our operational and investment cost structure.
Going strong into the second half of the Fiscal Year, we will continue to expand our Fast 4G Network to more areas of the country, raise customer acquisition and retention, expand data usage and create even more M-PESA use cases. Furthermore, we will launch our innovative affordable smartphone financing scheme which will enable our customers currently using a feature phone to upgrade their devices.
We would like to take this opportunity to thank our customers and stakeholders for their continuous support to make our venture in Ethiopia a great success.#FurtherAheadTogether
