The establishment of these Data Centers will help improve the availability of latest technologies mainly in the industrial parks to support the digitalization process, improving efficiency, transparency, and productivity
“We are excited to establish this win-win partnership with IPDC which will allow us to build our third Data Centre in Ethiopia, since Safaricom Ethiopia was awarded the Unified Telecommunications Service License, in July 2021. We commit to continue collaborate with the ICT park and provide latest network generation in agreed Industrial parks to support IPDC initiatives and in creating a smart city within the ICT park through targeted trial of innovative technologies,” said Anwar Sousa, CEO of Safaricom Ethiopia.
The construction of a modern data center within the ICT Park complements the park’s technological theme and ensures that IPDC enjoys reliable connectivity across all parks and digital spaces,” stated CEO of IPDC, Sandokan Debebe.
