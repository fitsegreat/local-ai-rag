Safaricom is excited to announce the launch of its commercial operations in the Tigray region, marking a significant step in our mission to provide reliable network services across Ethiopia.
Our expansion into Tigray will be executed in two phases. In phase one, 125 self-built towers have been constructed. Phase two will see the erection of 166 additional towers to reach the remaining cities.
Our phased approach ensures we build an independent, state-of-the-art 4G network that is 5G ready.
Setting up a great network takes time, and we are committed to enhancing and optimizing our network continually. Our network will seamlessly connect to the Global Mobile Network and is interconnected with the other network in Ethiopia, enabling effortless communication with users of the other service provider.
We have established a regional office in Tigray that has so far created direct employment opportunities for a dozen people, with more recruitment already underway. Thousands of indirect jobs are being generated through partnerships with local companies for distributing airtime, SIM cards, devices, and producing branding materials.
We extend our heartfelt gratitude to the Interim Regional Government of Tigray for the active support we received in making this project a reality.
