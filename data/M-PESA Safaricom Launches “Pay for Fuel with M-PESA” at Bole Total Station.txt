M-PESA Safaricom launches a new digital payment service that allows customers to Pay for Fuel with M-PESA, starting today at Bole Total Fuel Station in Addis Ababa. The service enables motorists to pay for fuel quickly and securely using their mobile phones.
Speaking at the event, Elsa Muzzolini, CEO of M-PESA, said: “Today is another exciting step forward in our journey to simplify lives through digital solutions. With Pay for Fuel with M-PESA, customers no longer need to carry cash or wait for change. Whether you’re a cab driver, a logistics business, or a family fueling on your way to work, this solution is designed for you. It’s more than a technological advancement, it’s about giving people back their time, peace of mind, and flexibility. We are also deeply grateful to the Ministry of Transport and Logistics for fostering a policy environment that encourages innovation and fair competition. Their commitment to creating a level playing field—where all digital financial service providers can contribute.”
The Fuel Aggregator service provides station attendants with a streamlined system to manage transactions. It maintains accurate records and tracks payment history while offering two access methods: new users register via phone number with SMS verification to create a PIN, while existing users log in with their PIN. For payments, attendants select Wallet (individuals) or Barrel (companies), input details, and initiate USSD requests for customer PIN confirmation. The Transaction Report feature also gives attendants a complete shift overview for accountability. Customers can simply dial *733#, enter the fuel amount, confirm via USSD, and drive off with ease.
This launch marks another milestone in Ethiopia’s digital journey. M-PESA Safaricom is proud to start at Bole Total Station and is working quickly to scale across all 2,000 fuel stations in Ethiopia. Station owners, fuel attendants, drivers, and customers are invited to embrace the service and be part of building a smarter, cashless future.
