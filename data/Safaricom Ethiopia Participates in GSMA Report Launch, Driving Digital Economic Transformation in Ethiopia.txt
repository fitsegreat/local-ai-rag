A delegation from Safaricom Ethiopia, led by our CEO Wim Vanhelleputte, participated in the launch of the GSMA report titled "Driving Digital Transformation of the Economy in Ethiopia."
The event brought together key stakeholders to discuss opportunities, policy reforms, and the role of mobile technology in accelerating the nation’s digital transformation.
The GSMA report outlines crucial policy recommendations aimed at enhancing the mobile sector’s contribution to Ethiopia’s digital objectives. If implemented, these reforms could connect an additional 30 million Ethiopians to the internet, representing a significant 70% increase in connectivity. Key recommendations include Telecom Reform Implementation, Investment Incentives, and Mobile Money Regulation, which align closely with the government’s Digital Ethiopia 2025 strategy aimed at leveraging digital technology for economic growth and social inclusion.
Wim Vanhelleputte emphasized Safaricom Ethiopia's commitment to this transformative journey, stating, “Our contributions align closely with the goals outlined in the Digital Ethiopia 2025 strategy, which aims to leverage digital technologies for economic growth, inclusivity, and improved public services.” He highlighted the company’s investment in building robust network infrastructure to support a Fast Data Network, ensuring reliable connectivity for all Ethiopians.
During the panel discussion, Vanhelleputte reiterated the vital role of the telecom industry as a development partner. He outlined how the government can further support the sector to foster greater innovation, particularly through collaborative infrastructure development, promoting financial inclusion, and reducing barriers to access by offering affordable devices and investing in digital literacy and skills training.
“Our focus on innovative solutions tailored to local needs, especially in impactful sectors like education, positions us as a catalyst for meaningful contributions to Ethiopia’s development,” he added.
The launch of the GSMA report marks a significant milestone in realizing Ethiopia's digital aspirations. Safaricom Ethiopia, as a new entrant in the liberalized telecom landscape, is uniquely positioned to leverage the international experience of its shareholders to drive digital inclusion and innovation.
As stakeholders come together to implement the report's recommendations, there is a shared vision of paving the way for a brighter, more connected future for all Ethiopians.
